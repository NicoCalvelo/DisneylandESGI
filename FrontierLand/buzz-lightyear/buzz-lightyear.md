## Buzz Lightyear

## Description

Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast is a shooting dark ride attraction located in Discoveryland at Disneyland Paris. It opened on April 8, 2006 as part of the Happiest Celebration on Earth honoring the 50th anniversary of Disneyland Park. It is a retheme of the former dark ride attraction, Les Mystères du Nautilus, based on Disney·Pixar's Toy Story films. The attraction takes you through Andy's room, where you are recruited by Buzz Lightyear to help defeat the Evil Emperor Zurg. The attraction features a ride system similar to the one used in the Buzz Lightyear attractions at other Disney parks, but with a unique soundtrack composed by John Debney.
