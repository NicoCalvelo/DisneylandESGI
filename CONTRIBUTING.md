# Contributing to this projet

## Welcome contributors to the project

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We are eager for contributions and so happy to found you here.

## Table of Contents

 If your CONTRIBUTING.md file is long, you might consider including a table 
of contents with links to different headings in your document. 

In github, each heading is given a URL by default, so you can link to that URL 
in the appropriate section of the Table of Contents for each heading. 

Do this in Markdown by wrapping the heading in [ ] and following with a parenthetical 
that includes the URL or header after # like [Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs).

## Giving references

Short Links to Important Resources:
   docs: handbook / roadmap (you'll learn more about this in the roadmapping session)
   bugs: issue tracker / bug report tool
   comms: forum link, developer list, IRC/email

## Testing
How to test the project, where the tests are located in your directories.


## Environment details

How to set up your development environment. This might exist in the README.md 
depending on the project. If so, include a link.

## How to submit changes

Pull Request protocol etc. You might also include what response they'll get back 
from the team on submission, or any caveats about the speed of response.

## How to report a bug 

Bugs are problems in code, in the functionality of an application or in its UI design; 
you can submit them through "bug trackers" and most projects invite you to do so,
so that they may "debug" with more efficiency and the input of a contributor. 

## Templates 

In this section of your file, you might also want to link to a bug report "template" 
like this one here which contributors can copy and add context to; this will keep 
your bugs tidy and relevant.

## First bugs for Contributors

Sometimes it is helpful to provide some guidelines for the types of bugs 
contributors should tackle (should they want to fix the bugs and 
not just submit them).

## How to request an "enhancement"

enhancements are features that you might like to suggest to a project, but aren't 
necessarily bugs/problems with the existing code; there is a "label" for 
enhancments in Github's Issues (where you report bugs), so you can tag issues 
as "enhancement," and thereby allow contributors to prioritize issues/bugs 
reported to the project.
