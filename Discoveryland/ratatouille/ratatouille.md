## Ratatouille

## Description

Ratatouille is a dark ride at Walt Disney Studios Park in Disneyland Paris. The ride is based on the 2007 DisneyÂ·Pixar film Ratatouille. It uses trackless ride technology, which is also used in Pooh's Hunny Hunt at Tokyo Disneyland and Mystic Manor at Hong Kong Disneyland. The ride is located in the park's Toon Studio section, underneath an area that is elevated by support columns imitating those of Parisian apartment buildings and features a small courtyard. The attraction also has a gift shop, La Boutique, at the exit of the attraction

###History###
Phantom Manor was originally conceived as a walkthrough attraction, but after the success of the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland, the concept was reworked into a ride-through attraction. The attraction was originally planned to be placed in Main Street, U.S.A., but was moved to Frontierland after the success of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. The attraction was originally planned to be called Thunder Mesa Haunted House, but was renamed Phantom Manor after Imagineers decided to make the attraction a darker version of the Haunted Mansion..
