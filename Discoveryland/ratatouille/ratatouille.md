## Ratatouille

## Description

Ratatouille is a dark ride at Walt Disney Studios Park in Disneyland Paris. The ride is based on the 2007 DisneyÂ·Pixar film Ratatouille. It uses trackless ride technology, which is also used in Pooh's Hunny Hunt at Tokyo Disneyland and Mystic Manor at Hong Kong Disneyland. The ride is located in the park's Toon Studio section, underneath an area that is elevated by support columns imitating those of Parisian apartment buildings and features a small courtyard. The attraction also has a gift shop, La Boutique, at the exit of the attraction.
