## Phantom Manor

### Description
Phantom Manor is a dark ride attraction located in Frontierland at Disneyland Park in Disneyland Paris. It is Disneyland Paris' version of the Haunted Mansion attractions at Disneyland, Magic Kingdom and Tokyo Disneyland, although a lot of scenes from the Haunted Mansion have been reimagined to coincide with a darker theme. Located in Frontierland, at the far corner of the Rivers of the Far West, this attraction takes you through the haunted house of the Ravenswood family. The story goes that the house was built on a mine, and the Ravenswood family was struck by a curse that caused mysterious deaths and disappearances.

### History

Phantom Manor is the only version of the Haunted Mansion attractions that is not a walk-through and that has a Western theme. The attraction opened with Euro Disneyland on April 12, 1992. The attraction was refurbished and reopened on April 3, 2019.
